# Charity Finder

This program will attempt to create a list of recommended charities for a user based on a series of user inputs.

The intention of this project is to create a program to allow users to find verified charities based on certain
responses, and how much value they attribute to those responses.

The project will be written in Rust and will utilize the [Charity Navigator data API](https://charity.3scale.net).
