# Charity Finder

The intention of this project is to create a program to allow users to find verified charities based on certain keywords
they enter.

The project will be written in Rust and will utilize the [Charity Navigator data API](https://charity.3scale.net).

The Charity Navigator web interface solves this problem and does so well. It provides a user interface and detailed
information on charities. This project serves more of an experimental purpose for getting more familiar with the Rust
programming language.
