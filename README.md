# Charity Finder

This program will attempt to create a list of recommended charities for a user based on a series of user inputs.

The intention of this project is to create a program to allow users to find verified charities based on certain
responses, and how much value they attribute to those responses.

The project will be written in Rust and will utilize the [Charity Navigator data API](https://charity.3scale.net).

## Progress

Starting off by asking the user specifically what they care about. Should mature app by asking different questions to
figure out what the user cares about. For example, might not know to research criminal justice reform, but might be
frustrated with policing / too big to fail banks. Methods for determining that should be developed.
